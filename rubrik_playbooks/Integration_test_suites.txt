Integration test suites:



Views of test suites:

Galaxy: http://galaxy.colo.rubrik.com/#/home

Results for a single pipeline


Atlantis: http://atlantis.rubrik.com/
Results for multiple runs



All suites are available on both dashboards


Where are test suites in the code?`

"sdmain/deployment/ansible/roles/jenkins_master/vars" contains yaml files, that have deails for each suite, and the test files of that suite



Actual test files are in:


1. Clytemnestra:

Covers Cqlproxy, Kronos, and few cockroach tests.



2. rktest(old)			:	//src/scripts/tests/rktest (Python)

			(has only one test suite, sdmain/src/scripts/tests/cqlproxy_test.py)

				test_correctness_main ()
				test_feature_java_driver (tests cassandra drivers, with cqlproxy)
				test_zzzbench_stress_validator_main (deletes and recreates sd schema for stress test, "zzz" is added to make it run last, alphabetically, to avoid impacting other tests)
				test_batch_stmts (tests batch statements)
 




3. rk_pytest (new)		:	//src/py/rk_pytest/cockroachdb, //src/py/rk_pytest/callisto, etc

https://rubrik.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/86164344/rk+pytest
		
		rk_pytest framework has fixtures for CDM cluster(via bodega), VMs and other resources,
		Even has a failure service (to inject failures like crash, filled HDD/SSD, clock skew) which can be plugged in using annotations 


	//src/py/rk_pytest/callisto,
	Has only one job for backup & restore


	//src/py/rk_pytest/cockroachdb
	Has all other cockroach tests, that run on cockroach DB cluster, that has no other CDM services installed. There are tests for:
		1. cockroach upgrade
		2. kronos
		3. ntp
		4. load test (https://rubrik.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/145326293)
		5. 



4. cassandraentitymanagertest	//src/java/sd/src/test/java/com/rubrik/apps/metadatastore
		These are scala tests, that aren't kept as part of build, pipeline, or sail process, as they are flaky. Ran manually by using "bazel test ..." in the above folder.
		Uses an in-memory mock of cockroach metadatastore



5. testserver: (somewhere between unit tests & integration tests)
		Starts cockroach db sngle node on random node, and runs tests on it.
		Can run using "src/go/BUILD.py --test --tags testserver"

 

6. Unit tests

	Most of these run with "arc sail"
	Post-op UTs not run with sail



7. Cockroach build

	2 jenkins jobs:
		1. to build a diff: Build_Cockroach
		to build tip of a branch:


8. roachtests

Tests that come wit cochroachdb
